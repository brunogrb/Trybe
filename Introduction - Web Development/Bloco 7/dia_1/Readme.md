## JavaScript ES6 - let, const, arrow functions and template literals

Below, you will see some specifications of algorithms to develop. It is essential that you use what you have learned about let, const, arrow functions and template literals.

1. Create a function that receives a number and returns its factorial.
  * In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative number N, with the notation N !, is the product of all integers less than or equal to N. Example: 4! = 4 3 2 * 1 = 24.
  * Bonus (optional): try to do the same exercise recursively.

2. Create a function that receives a sentence and returns the longest word.

3. Create a page that contains:
  * A button to which an event listener will be associated;
  * A clickCount variable in the JavaScript file that accumulates the number of clicks on the button;
  * A field in HTML that updates the number of clicks on the button as the clickCount variable is updated.

4. Create JavaScript code with the following specification:
  **Don't forget** to use template literals
  * Function 1: Write a function that will receive a string as a parameter. Your function should look for the letter x in any string you determine and replace it with the string you passed as a parameter. Your function must return this new string. **Example**:
    * Determined string: "Tryber x here!"
    * Parameter: "Bebeto"
    * Return: "Tryber Bebeto here!"
  * An array with global scope, which is the scope of the JS file, in this case, containing five strings with their main skills.
  
  * Function 2: Write a function that will receive the string returned from Function 1 as a parameter. This function must concatenate the skills of the global array to the string that was passed to Function 2 via parameter. You must order the skills in alphabetical order. Your function must return this new string. **Example**: "Tryber x here! My top five skills are:
    * JavaScript;
    * HTML; ...
