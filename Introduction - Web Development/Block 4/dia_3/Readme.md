## JavaScript - Programming Logic and Algorithms
1. For today's first exercise, make a program that, given any value n, whether n> 1, print on the screen a square made of side asterisks of size n.

2. For the second exercise, do the same as before, but print a right triangle with 5 base asterisks.

3. Now invert the side of the triangle.

4. Then, make a pyramid with n basic asterisks:

5. Make a pyramid with n base asterisks that is empty in the middle. Assume that the value of n will always be odd:

6. Make a program that says whether a number defined in a variable is prime or not.
     * A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself, that is, dividing it with any other numbers gives a remainder other than zero.
     * Tip: you will need to loop from 0 to the defined number; In addition, you will need to check each iteration and store the results somewhere.
