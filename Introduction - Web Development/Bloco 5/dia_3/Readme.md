### Exercises

#### Part I

- Mad Libs
Start with the webpage, which has several input elements and a button:
 (webpage in the exercise1-part1)
- Add a *script* tag to the bottom of the page for your code.
- Add an event listener to the button so that it calls a makeMadLib function when clicked.
- In the makeMadLib function, retrieve the current values of the form input elements, make a story from them, and output that in the story div (like "Pamela really likes pink cucumbers.")

* Calculator
Start with this webpage, which has inputs and buttons for things to calculate:

- Add a *script* tag, and add the functions from the calculator exercise (view the solution if you haven't done it yet).
- For each operation, create an event listener for the button, and when it's clicked, find the value of the appropriate input and show the result of the calculation in the solution div.
- Bonus: respond to key presses so that the user doesn't have to click the button.

#### Part II

- Add an HTML button in the area indicated below. Using an EventListener add an event to the button, where when clicking an alert containing the message "You clicked the button" should be displayed.
- To perform this task use the *script* tag. You must declare two variables, one called productPrice with a value of 59.99 and the other called discount with a value of 0.30. Then add a button to an HTML button below the *script* tag and using an EventListener add an event to that button, where when clicking, you must multiply productPrice by discount and then display an alert containing the message "Discount of (result) ", discount being the result of the multiplication.
