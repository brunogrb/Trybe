#### Instructions for performing the exercises

Imagine that you are the person responsible for developing a page that will serve as a reader of written content.
This written content can be a book page, a magazine report or an online newspaper note.

So far, nothing new, but this demand requires that you apply preferences of the people reading on the page to improve their reading experience.

People should have the power to change:
* Background color of the screen;
* Text color;
* Font size;
* Spacing between lines of text;
* Font type (Font family).

These preferences must be saved so that, when you return to the page, the preferences that were previously configured can be applied on the screen.

#### Bonus

The properties described above are mandatory, but you are free to add any other properties that you think are valid and that aim to improve the experience of the person who reads on your page.
