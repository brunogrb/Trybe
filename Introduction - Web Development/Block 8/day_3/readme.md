## JavaScript ES6 - Higher Order Functions - reduce

All exercises must be carried out using *reduce* and if necessary another HOF, the information will be quoted in the statement.

1. Given a matrix of matrices, transform it into a single matrix.

2. Create a string with the names of all authors.

3. Calculate the average age of the authors when their respective books were released.

4. Find the book with the biggest name.

5. Given the array of names, return the number of times the letter appears in uppercase or lowercase.

6. Now we are going to create a new array of objects from the information below, where each object will have the format **{name: student name, average: average of grades}**. For this we will assume that the position 0 of notes refers to the student in position 0 of students, here in addition to reduce it will also be necessary to use the map function. Tip: You can access the array index within the map, and you can see the expected object in the expected constant.
